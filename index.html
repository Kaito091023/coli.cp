            <p>                
                   She was beautiful, but not like those girls in the magazines. She was beautiful, for the<br>
                way she thought. She was beautiful, just like the sparkle in her eyes when she talked<br>
                about something she loves. She was beautiful, for her ability to make other people smile,<br>
                even if she was the complete opposite. No, she wasn't beautiful for something as temporary<br>
                as her looks. She was beautiful, not just her body but also deep down to her soul.<br>
                <br>
                   Even if loving you felt like a book out in the wind, even if the pages turned too fast for<br>
                me to read, I'd still choose you. Even if I didn't get the chance to adore you, to trace your<br>
                lines with my fingertip and re-read my favorite parts, I'd still choose you. To live the story<br>
                I know we're meant to create together, where each chapter unfolds with new adventures<br>
                and joy. I look forward to the many pages yet to be written in our beautiful tale, Tangi.
